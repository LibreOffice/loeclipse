   <description>
This plugin provides the support of C++ implementation for OpenOffice.org
component development. This plugin depends on the OpenOffice.org development
core plugin.

Even if this is a important piece of work, there are still other
features to add and bugs to correct, please do not hesitate to
express your remarks and requests on the ooo-build@lists.freedesktop.org 
mailing list.
