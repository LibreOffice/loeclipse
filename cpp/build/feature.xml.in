   <description>
This plugin provides the support of C++ implementation for LibreOffice
component development. This plugin depends on the LibreOffice development
core plugin.

Even if this is a important piece of work, there are still other
features to add and bugs to correct, please do not hesitate to
express your remarks and requests on the LibreOffice development 
mailing list.
