HOWTO internationalize this plugin ?

Create a new eclipse plugin fragment with the target ID: org.openoffice.ide.eclipse

Then create the following tree:

+ Fragment root
  + nl
    + <lang>
      + <country>
        + doc
          + cheatsheets
            + starting.xml
          + help
            + html
              + overview.html
            + toc.xml
  + org
    + openoffice
      + ide
        + eclipse
          + i18n
            + ImageManager_<lang>_<country>.properties
            + Translator_<lang>_<country>.properties
  + plugin_<lang>_<country>.properties
  
This tree is for one language, but you could add as much language as you want in one tree.
