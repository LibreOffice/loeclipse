	<item title="SDK Configuration">
	    <description>
	       First of all is to configure the available OpenOffice.org SDKs. You can 
	       add, remove and edit the SDKs that can be used in the plugin in the
	       preferences. Open the <b>Window-&gt;Preferences</b> menu item to get the preferences.
	       Afterwards, select the <b>OpenOffice.org-&gt;SDK Configuration</b> node.
	       <br />
	       Then add, remove and/or edit your SDKs, but remember that you need at least one.

	<item title="Creating a new UNO-IDL file">
	    <description>
	    	In your newly created UNO Component basic tree, you could add a new idl file.
	    	Select the <b>File-&gt;New-&gt;Others</b> menu item. From this point launch the 
	    	<b>new UNO-IDL file creation wizard</b>.
	    	<br />
	    	The only thing to now in this wizard is that you cannot create an idl file outside
