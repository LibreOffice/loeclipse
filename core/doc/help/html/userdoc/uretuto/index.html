<p>OpenOffice.org component model named UNO can be used to create
new applications. This is possible because a subset of OpenOffice.org
managing the UNO environment has been extracted to allow standalone
components. To use this subset, named URE, some UNO knowledge are
required. This document will show how every Java developer could create
its own URE application without too much effort thanks to the
OpenOffice.org Eclipse integration.</p>

<p>This tutorial is about guiding you through the creation of an URE
application. It supposes that you have already read the general Java
component tutorial. The <a href="../javatuto/index.html"><span class="emphasis"><em>&#8220;See
Java Component Tutorial&#8221;</em></span></a> mention in this document will ask you to
have a look at the Java component tutorial first. For the OpenOffice.org
Eclipse integration installation or explanations on the component,
please refer to the corresponding section in the Java component
tutorial.</p>
<p>Here are the definition of some terms and abbreviations used in
