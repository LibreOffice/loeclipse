			<h3 class="title">Installing the development platform</h3>
			<p>Now that you perfectly know what to do, we will install and 
	      configure the development tools. This is quite simple but you 
	      might be trapped into some problems if you don't ready the 
	      next lines carefully. I will now assume that you have none of the 
	      development tools.</p>
  
	      <h4 class="title">OpenOffice.org</h4>
	      <p>First of all, you will need to have a working 
	        OpenOffice.org 2.0 and it's Software Development Kit 
	        (SDK). The last version are available on the OpenOffice.org 
	        download pages for the most current platforms.</p>
	        
	      <p>If you have installed OpenOffice.org using a different 
	        distribution, please check that you have the development 
	        package. This tutorial assumes that you used the "Official"
	        OpenOffice.org distribution from the project's 
	        website.</p>
	        
	      <h4 class="title">Eclipse and the plugin</h4>
	      
	      <p>To get Eclipse, just get to their download pages and 
	        download the last Eclipse SDK. You will have Eclipse and 
	        it's SDK. Of course, you might want to download only the 
	        binary runtime, but you will have to follow more links. Once 
	        you have Eclipse, unzip it on your computer and that's it: 
	        eclipse has a Java plugin to help you program in Java.</p>
	        
	      <p>Now we will install the OpenOffice.org development plugin 
	        for Eclipse using the Eclipse software update system. Select 
	        the menu: <span class="guimenu">Help</span><span class="guisubmenu">Software 
	        updates</span><span class="guimenuitem">Find and 
	        install</span>, you should get the window of the 
	        illustration 2. Check the second option on this window and 
	        click on the <span class="guilabel">Next</span> button.</p>
	        
	      <div class="mediaobject" align="center">
	      	<img src="img/InstallWindow.png" align="middle" 
	      		  alt="Intall and update window" />
	      	<div class="caption">Illustration 2: Install and update window</div>
	      </div>
	      
	      <p>On the following page, you will see a list of <span class="guilabel">
	        update sites</span>. These are URLs pointing to directories 
	        containing plugins informations and archives. Now click on the 
	        <span class="guilabel">Add remote site</span> button to get a small 
	        window asking for a name that will be displayed in the list and 
	        an URL. The URL of OpenOffice.org plugin update site is:</p>
	        
	      <p style="text-align: center">
	        <a href="http://cedric.bosdonnat.free.fr/ooeclipseintegration" target="_top">
	        http://cedric.bosdonnat.free.fr/ooeclipseintegration</a></p>
	      
	      <p>Then validate the new update site parameters and be sure 
	        that the OpenOffice.org site is checked before clicking on the 
	        <span class="guilabel">Finish</span> button. You should now see a window 
	        like the one of the illustration 3. Select the OpenOffice.org 
	        plugin as shown on the screen-shot and click next and follow 
	        the indications. You will be asked to accept the plugin licence 
	        and validate the installation the archive are not signed.</p>
	        
	      <div class="mediaobject" align="center">
	      	<img src="img/PluginUpdates.png" align="middle" 
	      		  alt="OpenOffice.org update site contents" />
	      		  
	         <div class="caption">Illustration 3: OpenOffice.org update site contents</div>
	      </div>
	      
	      <p>Congratulations, you have installed the OpenOffice.org 
	        plugin successfully, there is now to configure it. The 
	        following steps will guide you through this task. Go to the 
	        Eclipse options via the <span class="guimenu">Window</span> <span class="guimenuitem">
	        Preferences...</span> menu. In the list on the left, 
	        select the <span class="guimenu">OpenOffice.org plugin</span> 
	        <span class="guimenuitem">SDK configuration</span> item to get a 
	        window like the one shown by the illustration 4.</p>
	        
	      <div class="mediaobject" align="center">
	      	<img src="img/UnoProperties.png" align="middle" 
	      		  alt="SDK configuration window"/>
	      	<div class="caption">Illustration 4: SDK configuration window</div>
	      </div>
	      
	      <p>In this window you will have to configure the path to 
	        your OpenOffice.org and to it's SDK. So let us begin with 
	        the SDK path: click on the <span class="guilabel">Add</span> button next 
	        to the SDKs list. You will have a window like the 
	        illustration 5, browse to your OpenOffice.org 2.0 SDK and 
	        validate. Then you will have to do the same for the 
	        OpenOffice.org path using the other <span class="guilabel">Add</span> 
	        button.</p>
	        
	      <div class="mediaobject" align="center">
	      	<img src="img/SdkConfig.png" align="middle" alt="New SDK path window"/>
	      	<div class="caption">Illustration 5: New SDK path window</div>
	      </div>
	      
	      <p>Now your OpenOffice.org plugin is ready to work: you can 
	        begin to create your new component. If there was any problem 
	        during the plugin installation, do not hesitate to report it to 
	        the <code class="email">&lt;<a href="mailto:dev@api.openoffice>dev@api.openoffice.org</a>&gt;</code> 
	        mailing-list.</p>
