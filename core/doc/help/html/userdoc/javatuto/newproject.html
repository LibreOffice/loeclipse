    	<h3 class="title">Creating the project</h3>
    	
    	<p>There are several ways to create a UNO project using the plugin:</p>
    	
    	<ul>
    		<li><p>the first one is the <span class="guimenu">File</span> 
            <span class="guisubmenu">New</span> <span class="guimenuitem">
            Project</span> menu entry and choose the <span class="guimenu">
            UNO</span> <span class="guimenuitem">UNO-IDL</span> Project 
            item as shown by the illustration 6.</p>
            
            <div class="mediaobject" align="center">
            	<img src="img/NewUnoProjectsItems.png" align="middle" 
            		  alt="New UNO-IDL project item" />
               <div class="caption">Illustration 6: New UNO-IDL project item</div>
            </div>
       	</li>
       	
       	<li><p>the second one is the icon in the toolbar 
            representing a blue folder with a star as shown by the 
            illustration 7.</p>
            
            <div class="mediaobject" align="center">
            	<img src="img/NewUnoProjectIcon.png" align="middle" 
            		  alt="New UNO-IDL project icon" />
            	<div class="caption">Illustration 7: New UNO-IDL project icon</div>
            </div>
         </li>
     	</ul>
     	
     	<p>Next you have to fill in a form (see illustration 8) to 
        configure your project: the next lines will describe the 
        different fields and their meaning to help you fill them.</p>
        
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center">
      	<img src="img/NewUnoProject.jpg" align="middle" 
      		  alt="New UNO-IDL project wizard page" />
        	<div class="caption">Illustration 8: New UNO-IDL project wizard page</div>
      </div>
            
      <dl>
      	<dt>Project name</dt>
      	<dd><p>is the component name, in our case, it will be 
              <span class="emphasis"><em>Helloworld</em></span></p>
         </dd>
         
         <dt>Directory</dt>
         <dd><p>is the directory on your computer where the project 
              will be created. You can change the default one by 
              deselecting the <span class="guilabel">Use default</span> check 
              box. The default location of each Eclipse project is a 
              directory with your project name in the current Eclipse 
              workspace.</p>
         </dd>
         
         <dt>Root package</dt>
         <dd><p>is the name of the first module of your component. 
              It generally composed of two parts: the vendor name (here 
              <span class="emphasis"><em>org.openoffice</em></span>) and the project name 
              (here <span class="emphasis"><em>helloworld</em></span>).</p>
         </dd>
         
         <dt>Used SDK</dt>
         <dd><p>selects the OpenOffice.org SDK which will be used 
              to develop the component. You generally will have only 
              one SDK in the list, but you can add others in the 
              preferences or by clicking on the <span class="guilabel">Configure 
              SDKs</span> button.</p>
         </dd>
         
         <dt>Used OOo</dt>
         <dd><p>selects the version of OpenOffice.org to use to 
              develop the component. As for the SDK, you will generally 
              have only one entry in the list, but you can add others 
              in the preferences or by clicking on the <span class="guilabel">OOo 
              Installations</span> button.</p>
         </dd>
         
         <dt>Programming language</dt>
         <dd><p>selects the programming language for the component 
              implementation. For the moment, there is only Java 
              available, however C++ and python are planned.</p>
         </dd>
      </dl>
     
     <p>You can now click on the <span class="guilabel">Finish</span>
         button or <span class="guilabel">Next</span>
         if you are eager to know a bit more on what will happen during 
         the project's creation. For this tutorial we will go 
         further to better understand what you will get after the 
         wizard. In fact the next step in the wizard will consist in 
         configuring an empty service for the component. The default 
         name of this service is the project name and it implements the 
         <code class="code">com.sun.star.uno.XInterface</code>
         interface. However you can change the default interface by 
         clicking on the <span class="guilabel">Browse</span>
         button which will provide you a list of the known interfaces.</p>
         
      <p>As we will define a new interface for our Helloworld 
      	service, we will keep the default values and change the interface 
      	name when we will have created it.</p>
