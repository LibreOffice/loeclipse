    	 <p>There is now to package and test our component. This part 
    		 will be a bit more hard because the plugin does not support these 
    		 features for the moment. The following lines will not explain all 
    		 the code in details because this should be done by the plugin in 
    		 future versions. However it is necessary now to test our 
    		 work.</p>
