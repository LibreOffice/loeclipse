    	<p>For the Eclipse plugin, an UNO component is a UNO project. 
    	   Thus the first step will consist in creating the project. Next, you 
    	   will need to write the UNO-IDL specifications of your component and 
    	   then implement them. This tutorial will guide you in the "Hello world" component 
    	   creation. The component you are about to create just says hello 
    	   when you ask him to do so.</p>
