      Tool to support OpenOffice.org development using Eclipse. It
provides two editors for UNO-IDL file edition and registry files
viewing. The plugin helps the user to write it&apos;s UNO-IDL file
with syntax highlighting and some wizards, it although generates
the type registries. 

KEEP IN MIND that this is only the core of the plugin: you will certainly
need to install the plugin corresponding to the programming language used
for the implementation. For example, to create a Java component, you need:
  + The OOo development core plugin
  + The OOo development Java plugin
  + Of course the Eclipse JDT

This plugin is user oriented and integrate some cheat sheets
to guide the new user throught different steps.
Even if this is a important piece of work, there are still other
features to add and bugs to correct, please do not hesitate to
express your remarks and requests on the dev@api openoffice mailing
list.
