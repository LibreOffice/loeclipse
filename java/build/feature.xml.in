   <description>
      Tool to support OpenOffice.org development using Eclipse. It
provides two editors for UNO-IDL file edition and registry files
viewing. The plugin helps the user to write it&apos;s UNO-IDL file
with syntax highlighting and some wizards, it although generates
the type registries and Java classes files. 
This plugin is user oriented and integrate some cheat sheets
to guide the new user throught different steps.
Even if this is a important piece of work, there are still other
features to add and bugs to correct, please do not hesitate to
express your remarks and requests on the dev@api openoffice mailing
list.
