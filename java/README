Building OOoEclipse Integration

in order to build OOoEclipseIntegration to produce an update site,
you need to have installed OpenOffice.org and Eclipse.You may install
only the necesary jars, but you'll have to hack the ant build.xml
files.

Define the ANT_ARGS variable to the following:
   -Dhome.openoffice=/path/to/you/ooo -Dhome.eclipse=/path/to/your/eclipse
Then you will just have to cd in the build CVS module and execute:
   prompt$ ant

Please run ant help to get the available targets
